# Vert.x Highways England RSS Polling Example

This is a small project which polls the [Highways England RSS feed](http://m.highways.gov.uk/feeds/rss/UnplannedEvents.xml) for unplanned events and does literally nothing with the information for now.


### Configuration
None yet.

### TBD
* Store events in JBoss Data Grid
* Create REST API to access data stored in JDG
* Create UI to return results from REST API.
